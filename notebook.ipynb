Candy Crush Saga\n<p><a href=\"https://king.com/game/candycrush\">Candy Crush Saga</a> is a hit mobile game developed by King (part of Activision|Blizzard) that is played by millions of people all around the world. The game is structured as a series of levels where players need to match similar candy together to (hopefully) clear the level and keep progressing on the level map. If you are one of the few that haven't played Candy Crush, here's a short demo:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/HGLGxnfs_t8\"><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_139/img/candy_crush_video.jpeg\" alt></a></p>\n<p>Candy Crush has more than 3000 levels, and new ones are added every week.

Computing level difficulty\n<p>Within each Candy Crush episode, there is a mix of easier and tougher levels. Luck and individual skill make the number of attempts required to pass a level different from player to player. The assumption is that difficult levels require more attempts on average than easier ones. That is, <em>the harder</em> a level is, <em>the lower</em> the probability to pass that level in a single attempt is.</p>\n<p>A simple approach to model this probability is as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_process\">Bernoulli process</a>; as a binary outcome (you either win or lose) characterized by a single parameter <em>p<sub>win</sub></em>: the probability of winning the level in a single attempt. This probability can be estimated for each level as:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_139/img/latex1.png\" style=\"width:150px\"></p>\n<!-- $$p_{win} = \\frac{\\sum wins}{\\sum attempts}$$ -->\n<p>For example, let's say a level has been played 10 times and 2 of those attempts ended up in a victory.
